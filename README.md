## machine_learning_demo

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning techniques. The dataset, includes features such as passenger class, age, gender, and ticket fare. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster.

In this project, I explored different machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers. The main steps include:
a) Handling missing values.
b) Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
c) Feature engineering, such as creating new features from existing ones.

For evaluation purpose I used confusion matrix. where it gives accuracy, f1 score, precision, recall for the model.

I later on saved the model as .pkl file and used the Flask application. The model can be deployed using a web framework like Flask for user interaction.
