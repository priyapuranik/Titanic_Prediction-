# Titanic Prediction using Machine learning

**This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning techniques.The dataset, includes features such as passenger class, age, gender, and ticket fare.** <br>
***The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster.***

**--In this project, I explored different machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers.** 

***The main steps include:*** <br>
a) Handling missing values. <br>
b) Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.<br>
c) Feature engineering, such as creating new features from existing ones.<br>

**--For evaluation purpose I used confusion matrix. where it gives accuracy, f1 score, precision, recall for the model.**

**--I later on saved the model as .pkl file and used the Flask application. The model can be deployed using a web framework like Flask for user interaction.** <br>
